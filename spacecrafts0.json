In October 1995, it was agreed that, amongst the various contributions to the ISS program that Europe would assume responsibility for under the vestiges of the European Space Agency (ESA), would be the Automated Transfer Vehicle, or ATV; this logistics-orientated spacecraft would perform the identified resupply missions to ISS.","details":"In terms of its role, the ATV was designed to complement the smaller Russian Progress spacecraft, possessing three times its useful payload capacity. Similar to the Progress, it would carry both bulk liquids and relatively fragile freight, which would be stored within a cargo hold maintained at a pressurized shirt-sleeve environment in order that astronauts would be able to access payloads without the need to put on spacesuits. The pressurized cargo section of the ATV was based on the Italian-built Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM), which was a Shuttle-carried \"space barge\" that had been previously used for transporting equipment to and from the Station. Unlike the MPLM, the ATV used the same docking mechanism as employed upon the Progress. The ATV, like the Progress, also serves as a container for the station's waste. Each ATV weighs 20.7 tonnes at launch and has a cargo capacity of 8 tonnes.","maiden_flight":"2008-03-09","height":10.3,"diameter":4.5,"human_rated":false,"crew_capacity":null,"payload_capacity":7667,"payload_return_capacity":null,"flight_life":"Six months when docked","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/automated_trans_image_20231118111716.jpeg","nation_url":null,"wiki_link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Transfer_Vehicle","info_link":""},{"id":28,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/spacecraft/28/?format=json","name":"Buran","type":{"id":3,"name":"Spaceplane"},"agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","featured":true,"type":"Government","country_code":"RUS","abbrev":"RFSA","description":"The Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities, commonly known as Roscosmos, is the governmental body responsible for the space science program of the Russian Federation and general aerospace research.
