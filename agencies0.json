In October 1995, it was agreed that, amongst the various contributions to the ISS program that Europe would assume responsibility for under the vestiges of the European Space Agency (ESA), would be the Automated Transfer Vehicle, or ATV; this logistics-orientated spacecraft would perform the identified resupply missions to ISS.","details":"In terms of its role, the ATV was designed to complement the smaller Russian Progress spacecraft, possessing three times its useful payload capacity. Similar to the Progress, it would carry both bulk liquids and relatively fragile freight, which would be stored within a cargo hold maintained at a pressurized shirt-sleeve environment in order that astronauts would be able to access payloads without the need to put on spacesuits. The pressurized cargo section of the ATV was based on the Italian-built Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM), which was a Shuttle-carried \"space barge\" that had been previously used for transporting equipment to and from the Station. Unlike the MPLM, the ATV used the same docking mechanism as employed upon the Progress. The ATV, like the Progress, also serves as a container for the station's waste. Each ATV weighs 20.7 tonnes at launch and has a cargo capacity of 8 tonnes.","maiden_flight":"2008-03-09","height":10.3,"diameter":4.5,"human_rated":false,"crew_capacity":null,"payload_capacity":7667,"payload_return_capacity":null,"flight_life":"Six months when docked","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/automated_trans_image_20231118111716.jpeg","nation_url":null,"wiki_link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Transfer_Vehicle","info_link":""}]},{"id":139,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/139/?format=json","name":"Armadillo Aerospace","featured":false,"type":"Commercial","country_code":"USA","abbrev":"Armadillo","description":null,"administrator":null,"founding_year":null,"launchers":"","spacecraft":"","parent":null,"launch_library_url":null,"total_launch_count":0,"successful_launches":0,"consecutive_successful_launches":0,"failed_launches":0,"pending_launches":0,"successful_landings":0,"failed_landings":0,"attempted_landings":0,"consecutive_successful_landings":0,"info_url":"http://armadilloaerospace.com/n.x/Armadillo/Home","wiki_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo_Aerospace","logo_url":null,"image_url":null,"nation_url":null,"launcher_list":[],"spacecraft_list":[]},{"id":271,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/271/?format=json","name":"Army Ballistic Missile Agency","featured":false,"type":"Government","country_code":"USA","abbrev":"ABMA","description":"The Army Ballistic Missile Agency was formed to develop the U.S. Army's first large ballistic missile.

It consisted of two parts: the conical Command Module, a cabin that housed the crew and carried equipment needed for atmospheric reentry and splashdown; and the cylindrical Service Module which provided propulsion, electrical power and storage for various consumables required during a mission. An umbilical connection transferred power and consumables between the two modules. Just before reentry of the Command Module on the return home, the umbilical connection was severed and the Service Module was cast off and allowed to burn up in the atmosphere.","maiden_flight":"1966-02-26","height":11,"diameter":3.9,"human_rated":true,"crew_capacity":3,"payload_capacity":1050,"payload_return_capacity":null,"flight_life":"14 days","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/apollo2520command2fservice2520module_image_20190207032507.jpeg","nation_url":null,"wiki_link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Command/Service_Module","info_link":""}]},{"id":257,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/257/?format=json","name":"Northrop Grumman Space Systems","featured":true,"type":"Commercial","country_code":"USA","abbrev":"NGSS","description":"Northrup Grumman Space Systems designs, builds and delivers space, defence and aviation-related systems to customers around the world.

Their Delta IV launches from LC-37 at Cape Canaveral and LC-6 at Vandenberg.","administrator":"CEO: Tory Bruno","founding_year":"2006","launchers":"Atlas | Delta IV | Vulcan","spacecraft":"CST-100 Starliner","parent":null,"launch_library_url":null,"total_launch_count":163,"successful_launches":163,"consecutive_successful_launches":163,"failed_launches":0,"pending_launches":44,"successful_landings":0,"failed_landings":0,"attempted_landings":0,"consecutive_successful_landings":0,"info_url":"http://www.ulalaunch.com/","wiki_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/united2520launch2520alliance_logo_20210412195953.png","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/united_launch_a_image_20210412201210.png","nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/united2520launch2520alliance_nation_20230531043703.jpg","launcher_list":[{"id":182,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/182/?format=json","name":"Atlas V","description":"Atlas V is an expendable launch system in the Atlas rocket family.

The first incarnation of Vought was established by Chance M. Vought and Birdseye Lewis in 1917. In 1928, it was acquired by United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, which a few years later became United Aircraft Corporation; this was the first of many reorganizations and buyouts. During the 1920s and 1930s, Vought Aircraft and Chance Vought specialized in carrier-based aircraft for the United States Navy, by far its biggest customer. Chance Vought produced thousands of planes during World War II, including the F4U Corsair. Vought became independent again in 1954, and was purchased by Ling-Temco-Vought in 1961. The company designed and produced a variety of planes and missiles throughout the Cold War. Vought was sold from LTV and owned in various degrees by the Carlyle Group and Northrop Grumman in the early 1990s. It was then fully bought by Carlyle, renamed Vought Aircraft Industries, with headquarters in Dallas, Texas.
