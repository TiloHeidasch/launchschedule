Initially designed with a pulsed-plasma thruster to train Air Force Academy cadets (see JAWSAT), the mission has since evolved to include the efforts of several universities, local aerospace companies, the Air Force Academy, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and NASA. Utilizing breakthrough technologies, JAWSAT deployed four satellites when it reached orbit. The onboard imaging system recorded the deployment of each payload with its six digital cameras. The first free-flying Academy satellite, FalconSat-1 carried the CHAWS (Charging Hazards and Wake Studies) experiment developed by the Physics Department at the Academy.","type":"Test Flight"},"pad":{"id":8,"name":"Space Launch Complex 8","location":{"id":11,"name":{"id":11,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/11/?format=json","name":"Vandenberg SFB, CA, USA","country_code":"USA","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg","timezone_name":"America/Los_Angeles","total_launch_count":769,"total_landing_count":20}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_8_20200803143300.jpg"},"vidURLs":[],"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/minotaur2520i_image_20190224012247.jpeg","infographic":null},{"id":"4f7aa53f-626c-41a9-b0df-898a43a02f22","name":"Long March 3A | Zhongxing 22","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"2000-01-25T16:45:05Z","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":88,"name":"China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation","abbrev":"CASC","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/china2520aerospace2520science2520and2520technology2520corporation_logo_20220826093937.png","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/china2520aerospace2520science2520and2520technology2520corporation_image_20191228094408.jpeg","nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/china2520aerospace2520science2520and2520technology2520corporation_nation_20230604193716.png"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":71,"name":"Long March 3A","family":"Long March","full_name":"Long March 3A"}},"mission":{"id":5355,"name":"Zhongxing 22","description":"Chinese military geostationary communications satellite","type":"Communications"},"pad":{"id":45,"name":"Launch Complex 2 (LC-2)","location":{"id":16,"name":{"id":16,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/16/?format=json","name":"Xichang Satellite Launch Center, People's Republic of China","country_code":"CHN","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_16_20200803142513.jpg","timezone_name":"Asia/Shanghai","total_launch_count":210,"total_landing_count":0}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_45_20200803143520.jpg"},"vidURLs":[],"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/long2520march25203a_image_20190222031143.png","infographic":null},{"id":"05ea7f72-be63-473f-9e1f-e3fc96111fe6","name":"Ariane 42L | Galaxy 10R","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"2000-01-25T01:04:00Z","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":115,"name":"Arianespace","abbrev":"ASA","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/arianespace_logo_20210603173752.png","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/arianespace_image_20190207032425.jpeg","nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/arianespace_nation_20230530190314.jpg"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":223,"name":"Ariane 42L","family":"Ariane 4","full_name":"Ariane 42L"}},"mission":{"id":5354,"name":"Galaxy 10R","description":"American communications satellite.","type":"Communications"},"pad":{"id":124,"name":"Ariane Launch Area 2","location":{"id":13,"name":{"id":13,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/13/?format=json","name":"Guiana Space Centre, French Guiana","country_code":"GUF","description":"The Guiana Space Centre is a European spaceport to the northwest of Kourou in French Guiana, a region of France in South America.

Therfore several transponders are not operational, so EchoStar 4 did not replace EchoStar 1. In Jul 1999 further anomalies with thermal control and fuel systems were reported. Only 16 transponders are reported to be operational. EchoStar has filled for constructive total loss of the satellite, which was insured for $220 million. In Jun 1999 the FCC approved a move request to 110Â°W to allow EchoStar to start broadcasting from there. Earlier the FCC granted to transfer of the 110Â°W licence of MCI to EchoStar. During May 1999, EchoStar IV experienced anomalies affecting transponders, heating systems and the fuel system. In July 1999, additional fuel system anomalies were confirmed. By 31 October 2000, a total of 26 transponders of 44 aboard failed and by 30 June 2002, 38 transponders had failed. Only six transponders were available for use at this time.

They were placed over the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans, respectively. In August 1993, PanAmSat ordered a fourth satellite, to be used as a spare. The spare was pressed into service to replace the first PAS-3 spacecraft, which was lost during a launch vehicle failure. The MEASAT system will provide the first direct-to-user (DTU) service in Malaysia, as well as general communications services in an area reaching from India to Hawaii and from Japan to East Australia. Among DTU services are television and educational programs beamed to small (50-cm) home antennas.

They docked with Mir two days later. During their stay there, cosmonauts performed several EVAs to prepare for the docking of the new Spektr module. Station crew was visited by several Progress resupply spacecrafts, and welcomed aboard the STS-71 with the 19th expedition crew. \nCrews exchanged vehicles, and members of the 18th expedition returned aboard STS-71, landing safely back on Earth on 7 July 1995, 14:55:28 UTC.
