The scientific program for the flight was prepared entirely by Bulgarian scientists, along with some of the equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough take-off was smooth, the mission was a disaster, with severe damage of the engine preventing docking in orbit to Salyut 6 orbital station as it was initially planned. A premature return to Earth became the only possible decision for Ivanov and Rukavishnikov. Due to some additional technical problems landing was difficult to endure-more than 9Gs. When Soyuz 33 finally landed, it was 320 kilometres (200 mi) southeast of Dzhezkazgan. It completed 31 orbits, and was in space for 1 day, 23 hours, and 1 minute. The flight remains the only example for manual landing and is thus quoted in every astronautic textbook.","profile_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/astronaut_images/georgi2520ivanov_image_20181129231428.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/default/cache/aa/af/aaafd7091049621fa1127d66d7809b7f.jpg","agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"c587ed55-76e7-4e59-9a33-25bb5f21cbf8","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/soyuz2520u_image_20190222031023.jpeg","name":"Soyuz-U | Soyuz 33","net":"1979-04-10T17:34:34Z"}],"last_flight":"1979-04-10T17:34:34Z","first_flight":"1979-04-10T17:34:34Z"},{"id":156,"name":"Sigmund J\xe4hn","nationality":"German","date_of_birth":"1937-02-13","date_of_death":"2019-09-21","bio":"Sigmund Werner Paul J\xe4hn (born 13 February 1937) is a German cosmonaut and pilot, who in 1978 became the first German to fly in space as part of the Soviet Union\'s Interkosmos programme.","profile_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/astronaut_images/sigmund2520j25c325a4hn_image_20181129231552.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/default/cache/1f/c2/1fc252af11c8c5a6b67a321db1f5d73b.jpg","agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"ebd27066-16ca-4039-ac18-858aa79201e6","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/soyuz2520u_image_20190222031023.jpeg","name":"Soyuz-U | Soyuz 31","net":"1978-08-26T14:51:30Z"}],"last_flight":"1978-08-26T14:51:30Z","first_flight":"1978-08-26T14:51:30Z"},{"id":157,"name":"Jing Haipeng","nationality":"Chinese","date_of_birth":"1966-10-24","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Jing Haipeng (simplified Chinese: \u666f\u6d77\u9e4f; traditional Chinese: \u666f\u6d77\u9d6c; pinyin: J\u01d0ng H\u01ceip\xe9ng; born October 24, 1966) is a Chinese pilot and astronaut selected as part of the Shenzhou program.

He was born in Danville, Illinois. He is unusual among astronauts as he did not have a background in flight test nor did he earn any advanced academic degrees. Typically those who did not do military flight test have an M.D. or Ph.D., if not a master\'s, whereas Tanner\'s path to becoming an astronaut followed operational military flying and then into NASA for operational jet training before being selected into the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1992, following an unsuccessful application in 1987.","profile_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/astronaut_images/joseph2520r.2520tanner_image_20181202150042.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/default/cache/8f/85/8f85321791d09d60c4212ac868dd2497.jpg","agency":{"id":44,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"de2170af-2f6f-42e1-a666-46c0e8cccc31","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520atlantis2520ov-104_image_20190222030553.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Atlantis / OV-104 | STS-66","net":"1994-11-03T16:59:43Z"},{"id":"c3e548b4-d9df-4e17-9322-f1a8af910047","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520discovery2520ov-103_image_20190222030538.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Discovery / OV-103 | STS-82","net":"1997-02-11T08:55:17Z"},{"id":"26b5d36f-bbdc-4ddc-ab87-7712b9f053c1","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520endeavour2520ov-101_image_20190222030547.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Endeavour / OV-105 | STS-97","net":"2000-12-01T03:06:00Z"},{"id":"85349e47-483e-4360-b64e-894bdc45d04f","image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/space2520shuttle2520atlantis2520ov-104_image_20190222030553.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Atlantis / OV-104 | STS-115","net":"2006-09-09T15:14:55Z"}],"last_flight":"2006-09-09T15:14:55Z","first_flight":"1994-11-03T16:59:43Z"},{"id":458,"name":"Andy Thomas","nationality":"American","date_of_birth":"1951-12-18","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Andrew \\"Andy\\" Sydney Withiel Thomas, AO is an Australian-born American aerospace engineer and a NASA astronaut.
