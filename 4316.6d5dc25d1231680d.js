The first incarnation of Vought was established by Chance M. Vought and Birdseye Lewis in 1917. In 1928, it was acquired by United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, which a few years later became United Aircraft Corporation; this was the first of many reorganizations and buyouts. During the 1920s and 1930s, Vought Aircraft and Chance Vought specialized in carrier-based aircraft for the United States Navy, by far its biggest customer. Chance Vought produced thousands of planes during World War II, including the F4U Corsair. Vought became independent again in 1954, and was purchased by Ling-Temco-Vought in 1961. The company designed and produced a variety of planes and missiles throughout the Cold War. Vought was sold from LTV and owned in various degrees by the Carlyle Group and Northrop Grumman in the early 1990s. It was then fully bought by Carlyle, renamed Vought Aircraft Industries, with headquarters in Dallas, Texas. In June 2010, the Carlyle Group sold Vought to the Triumph Group.","administrator":null,"founding_year":"1917","launchers":"","spacecraft":"","launch_library_url":"https://launchlibrary.net/1.4/agency/1006","total_launch_count":112,"consecutive_successful_launches":25,"successful_launches":102,"failed_launches":10,"pending_launches":0,"consecutive_successful_landings":0,"successful_landings":0,"failed_landings":0,"attempted_landings":0,"info_url":null,"wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought","logo_url":null,"image_url":null,"nation_url":null},"program":[],"variant":"A","alias":"","min_stage":4,"max_stage":4,"length":25,"diameter":1.01,"maiden_flight":"1965-12-22","launch_cost":"8610000","launch_mass":17,"leo_capacity":122,"gto_capacity":null,"to_thrust":513,"apogee":null,"vehicle_range":null,"image_url":null,"info_url":null,"wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(rocket_family)","total_launch_count":11,"consecutive_successful_launches":11,"successful_launches":11,"failed_launches":0,"pending_launches":0},{"id":357,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/launcher/357/?format=json","name":"Scout A-1","description":"The Scout family of rockets were were American launch vehicles designed to place small satellites into orbit around the Earth.
