The other 4 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites are to be launched at a later date.\r\n\r\nThey will be launched to low Earth orbit between 600 and 700 km by 2025, enabling South Korea’s military to observe the nuclear-armed neighbor’s key military facilities every two hours with 30-50 centimeters resolution imagery, according to a 2019 report produced by the Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation and Planning.\r\n\r\nThe project is lead by the Korean Agency for Defense Development (ADD) and Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), with input from Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), Hanwha Systems and Thales Alenia Space.\r\n\r\nESA's EIRSAT-1 is also onboard as a rideshare passenger. This 2U cubesat carries three experiments, including a novel gamma ray detector to study some of the most luminous explosions in the universe.","type":"Government/Top Secret"},"pad":{"id":16,"name":"Space Launch Complex 4E","location":{"id":11,"name":{"id":11,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/11/?format=json","name":"Vandenberg SFB, CA, USA","country_code":"USA","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg","timezone_name":"America/Los_Angeles","total_launch_count":769,"total_landing_count":20}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg"},"vidURLs":[{"priority":7,"source":"youtube.com","publisher":"The Space Devs","title":"SpaceX 425 Project Flight 1 & rideshare","description":"On Friday December 01, 2023, SpaceX launched the 425 Project Flight 1 & rideshare mission with a Falcon 9 Block 5 from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg ...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0FwlXB1KUP4/maxresdefault.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FwlXB1KUP4","type":{"id":4,"name":"Unofficial Re-stream"},"language":{"id":1,"name":"English","code":"en"},"start_time":"2023-12-01T18:38:29Z","end_time":"2023-12-01T19:00:08Z"},{"priority":8,"source":"youtube.com","publisher":"VideoFromSpace","title":"SpaceX launches South Korean spy satellite and more, lands in California","description":"SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launched the Korea 425 mission from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on December 1st at 1:19pm ET for the launch of the Kor...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-c19v3TGgKs/maxresdefault.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c19v3TGgKs","type":{"id":4,"name":"Unofficial Re-stream"},"language":{"id":1,"name":"English","code":"en"},"start_time":"2023-12-01T18:10:44Z","end_time":"2023-12-01T18:29:26Z"},{"priority":9,"source":"youtube.com","publisher":"European Space Agency, ESA","title":"Ad Astra: Launch of EIRSAT-1","description":"Watch live as Ireland goes to space, for the first time, with the launch of EIRSAT-1.

satellite communications operator Inmarsat. It consists of a dual mission to augment both L-band and Ka-band Global Xpress services.\r\n\r\nAirbus Defence and Space has been awarded a contract by Inmarsat to design and develop the first two Inmarsat-6 (I-6) mobile communications satellites, creating the most versatile mobile services satellites in its fleet.\r\n\r\nThe two I-6 satellites are based on Airbus Defence and Space's Eurostar platform in its E3000e variant, which exclusively uses electric propulsion for orbit raising. The satellites take advantage of the reduction in mass that this electric propulsion technology enables for a dual payload mission, with an exceptionally large next generation digitally processed payload.\r\n\r\nI-6 F1 and F2 both carry a large 9 m aperture L-band antenna and nine multibeam Ka-band antennas, and feature a high level of flexibility and connectivity. A new generation modular digital processor provides full routing flexibility over up to 8000 channels and dynamic power allocation to over 200 spot beams in L-band. Ka-band spot beams are steerable over the full Earth disk, with flexible channel to beam allocation.","type":"Communications"},"pad":{"id":80,"name":"Space Launch Complex 40","location":{"id":12,"name":{"id":12,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/12/?format=json","name":"Cape Canaveral, FL, USA","country_code":"USA","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_12_20200803142519.jpg","timezone_name":"America/New_York","total_launch_count":973,"total_landing_count":55}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_80_20200803143323.jpg"},"vidURLs":[{"priority":10,"source":null,"publisher":null,"title":"Inmarsat I-6 F2 Mission","description":"SpaceX is targeting Friday, February 17 for launch of the Inmarsat I-6 F2 mission to orbit from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PxfFL249aoU/maxresdefault_live.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfFL249aoU","type":null,"language":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null}],"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/falcon2520925_image_20240101101051.jpeg","infographic":null},{"id":"ae6b4088-983b-413d-baca-11c5650167d1","name":"Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 2-5","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"2023-02-17T19:12:20Z","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":121,"name":"SpaceX","abbrev":"SpX","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spacex_logo_20220826094919.png","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spacex_image_20190207032501.jpeg","nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spacex_nation_20230531064544.jpg"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":164,"name":"Falcon 9","family":"Falcon","full_name":"Falcon 9 Block 5"}},"mission":{"id":6256,"name":"Starlink Group 2-5","description":"A batch of 51 satellites for Starlink mega-constellation -

It's the first space solar observatory of China.\r\n\r\nASO-S is a 3-axis stabilized satellite with a mass of less than 1,000 kg with a pointing accuracy of 0.01° and an orientation stability of 1 to 2 arc seconds every 20 seconds. The payload has a mass below 335 kg and consumes about 300 watts. The platform's pointing accuracy is lower than 0.01°, the measurement accuracy is lower than 1 arc second and the orientation drift is below 0.0004°/s.\r\n\r\nASO-S has three instruments:\r\n\r\n- The Full-Disc Vector Magnetograph (FMG) instrument is intended to map the magnetic field of the photosphere over the entire solar disk. It includes an imager, an optical polarization system and a CCD detector.\r\n\r\n- The Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) camera should image the whole solar disk in X-rays. The instrument is optimized to take images of solar flares.\r\n\r\n- A set of three LST (Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope) telescopes is used to observe the Lyman-alpha line (121.6 nm) of solar flares up to a distance of several solar radii from the Sun's disk. These three telescopes are SDI (to obtain an image of the solar disk), SCI (coronagraph for observation between 1.1 and 2.5 solar radii) and WST (white light emitted by the solar disk used for calibration purposes).","type":"Heliophysics"},"pad":{"id":22,"name":"Launch Area 4 (SLS-2 /
