He was made a prime crew member of Soyuz MS-04 but, due to Russian budget cuts, the crews were changed and Tikhonov was then slated to make his first spaceflight on the Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft. He was again removed from the manifest due to delays in launching the Russian Nauka module. He was scheduled to fly into space as commander of the Soyuz MS-15 mission, although he was removed for a third time following the aborted launch of Soyuz MS-10, and the subsequent crew changes that followed. He was then scheduled to finally make his first flight onboard Soyuz MS-16 in 2020. However he reportedly got an eye injury a month before the launch, was replaced on the flight, and subsequently left the cosmonaut corps due to health issues.","profile_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/nikolai2520tikhonov_image_20200129210520.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/255bauto255d__image_thumbnail_20240305191106.jpeg","agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"flights":[],"last_flight":null,"first_flight":null},{"id":645,"name":"Andrei Babkin","nationality":"Russian","date_of_birth":"1969-04-21","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Andrei Nikolaevich Babkin (Russian: Андре́й Никола́евич Ба́бкин) is a Russian Engineer and Cosmonaut who was selected in April 2010.","profile_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/andrei2520babkin_image_20200129210447.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/255bauto255d__image_thumbnail_20240305185251.jpeg","agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"flights":[],"last_flight":null,"first_flight":null},{"id":646,"name":"Ivan Vagner","nationality":"Russian","date_of_birth":"1985-07-10","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Ivan Viktorovitch Vagner is a Russian Engineer and Cosmonaut who was selected in October 2010.

But it was the opportunity to do legislative research for U.S. Senator John Glenn – the former Mercury astronaut –that cemented his lifelong passion for space.

Now, after flying aboard ‘Galactic 06,’ space travel has forever changed the way Neil looks at the universe and his place in it, just as Glenn told him it would.

The purpose of this expedition was to test for NASA a meter called a Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC): testing at different altitudes (17,000 ft, 19,000 ft and 21,000 ft) would reveal how people’s bodies would be affected, including the way bodily tissues behaved, when struck by radiation, and this was important for the planning of long duration space missions.","profile_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/karl2520g.2520henize_image_20181129204738.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/255bauto255d__image_thumbnail_20240305185603.jpeg","agency":{"id":44,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"ad18f1d5-0cf8-49a1-a58b-ed36bee7af79","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/space_shuttle_image_20230422074810.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Challenger / OV-099 | STS-51-F","net":"1985-07-29T21:00:00Z"}],"last_flight":"1985-07-29T21:00:00Z","first_flight":"1985-07-29T21:00:00Z"},{"id":134,"name":"Thomas Hennen","nationality":"American","date_of_birth":"1952-08-17","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Chief Warrant Officer 4 Thomas John Hennen is a United States Army warrant officer and NASA astronaut who flew aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-44 as a Payload Specialist.","profile_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/thomas2520hennen_image_20181129204858.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/255bauto255d__image_thumbnail_20240305190921.jpeg","agency":{"id":44,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"33eee486-cd6f-4b78-a8f6-392447173f81","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/space_shuttle_image_20230422074810.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Atlantis / OV-104 | STS-44","net":"1991-11-24T23:44:00Z"}],"last_flight":"1991-11-24T23:44:00Z","first_flight":"1991-11-24T23:44:00Z"},{"id":135,"name":"Terence Henricks","nationality":"American","date_of_birth":"1952-07-05","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Terence Thomas \"Tom\" Henricks is a retired colonel in the United States Air Force and a former NASA astronaut.

A premature return to Earth became the only possible decision for Ivanov and Rukavishnikov. Due to some additional technical problems landing was difficult to endure-more than 9Gs. When Soyuz 33 finally landed, it was 320 kilometres (200 mi) southeast of Dzhezkazgan. It completed 31 orbits, and was in space for 1 day, 23 hours, and 1 minute. The flight remains the only example for manual landing and is thus quoted in every astronautic textbook.","profile_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/georgi2520ivanov_image_20181129231428.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/255bauto255d__image_thumbnail_20240305190928.jpeg","agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"c587ed55-76e7-4e59-9a33-25bb5f21cbf8","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/soyuz2520u_image_20190222031023.jpeg","name":"Soyuz-U | Soyuz 33","net":"1979-04-10T17:34:34Z"}],"last_flight":"1979-04-10T17:34:34Z","first_flight":"1979-04-10T17:34:34Z"},{"id":156,"name":"Sigmund Jähn","nationality":"German","date_of_birth":"1937-02-13","date_of_death":"2019-09-21","bio":"Sigmund Werner Paul Jähn (born 13 February 1937) is a German cosmonaut and pilot, who in 1978 became the first German to fly in space as part of the Soviet Union's Interkosmos programme.","profile_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/sigmund2520j25c325a4hn_image_20181129231552.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/255bauto255d__image_thumbnail_20240305185419.jpeg","agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"ebd27066-16ca-4039-ac18-858aa79201e6","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/soyuz2520u_image_20190222031023.jpeg","name":"Soyuz-U | Soyuz 31","net":"1978-08-26T14:51:30Z"}],"last_flight":"1978-08-26T14:51:30Z","first_flight":"1978-08-26T14:51:30Z"},{"id":157,"name":"Jing Haipeng","nationality":"Chinese","date_of_birth":"1966-10-24","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Jing Haipeng (simplified Chinese: 景海鹏; traditional Chinese: 景海鵬; pinyin: Jǐng Hǎipéng; born October 24, 1966) is a Chinese pilot and astronaut selected as part of the Shenzhou program.

It was discovered that a valve had opened just prior to leaving orbit that had allowed the capsule's atmosphere to vent away into space, causing Volkov and his two flight companions to suffer fatal hypoxia as their cabin descended toward the earth's atmosphere.","profile_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/vladislav2520volkov_image_20181201224807.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/255bauto255d__image_thumbnail_20240305185704.jpeg","agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"flights":[{"id":"97e9d491-5c21-49bc-a240-1fb28bf6d532","image":null,"name":"Soyuz | Soyuz 11","net":"1971-06-06T04:55:09Z"},{"id":"22466699-fde9-4c67-9a59-d6962e8ab726","image":null,"name":"Soyuz | Soyuz 7","net":"1969-10-12T10:44:42Z"}],"last_flight":"1971-06-06T04:55:09Z","first_flight":"1969-10-12T10:44:42Z"},{"id":284,"name":"Boris Volynov","nationality":"Russian","date_of_birth":"1934-12-18","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Boris Valentinovich Volynov (Russian: Бори́с Валенти́нович Волы́нов; born 18 December 1934) is a Soviet cosmonaut who flew two space missions of the Soyuz programme: Soyuz 5, and Soyuz 21.

He graduated from the University of Utah with an undergraduate degree in physics in 1953. Following his military service obligation, he earned a Ph.D. in high-energy nuclear physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1964.\r\n\r\nLind was a naval aviator and attained the rank of Commander in the United States Naval Reserve. He had active duty in San Diego and aboard the carrier USS Hancock.\r\n\r\nAfter completing his doctorate, Lind worked at NASA's Goddard Research Center from 1964 to 1966. During this period, he applied for the third group of astronauts but did not have enough flight hours. He applied for the fourth group, but was denied for being too old. The age restriction was raised for the fifth group, and he was selected with the Original Nineteen in 1966. Lind helped to develop the Apollo 11 EVA activities, and served as CAPCOM for the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions.

He left NASA in 2013 to become a pilot for Virgin Galactic.","profile_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/frederick_w._st_image_20210522153643.jpeg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/255bauto255d__image_thumbnail_20240305190532.jpeg","agency":{"id":1024,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/1024/?format=json","name":"Virgin Galactic","type":"Private"},"flights":[{"id":"206ec3ec-d265-4f74-b7c1-40ef231ef1d2","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spaceshiptwo_image_20210522140909.jpeg","name":"SpaceShipTwo | Galactic 06","net":"2024-01-26T17:42:05Z"},{"id":"b17abaa1-ef18-4c29-9ed9-a02eb4967bfa","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spaceshiptwo_image_20210522140909.jpeg","name":"SpaceShipTwo | Galactic 04","net":"2023-10-06T16:10:30Z"},{"id":"6229654f-e7ea-4d97-80f7-0195161e8645","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spaceshiptwo_image_20210522140909.jpeg","name":"SpaceShipTwo | Galactic 02","net":"2023-08-10T15:17:00Z"},{"id":"384ab3d5-6628-4e14-9f33-50212b52c539","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spaceshiptwo_image_20210522140909.jpeg","name":"SpaceShipTwo | VSS Unity 25","net":"2023-05-25T16:23:00Z"},{"id":"8a9895bf-5618-47e7-b7b1-9c84fca06ed8","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spaceshiptwo_image_20210522140909.jpeg","name":"SpaceShipTwo | VSS Unity 24","net":"2023-04-26T13:47:00Z"},{"id":"6ddd646c-18f8-43db-8171-11d5670cc1a6","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/space_shuttle_image_20230422074810.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Endeavour / OV-105 | STS-88","net":"1998-12-04T08:35:34Z"},{"id":"02ef655f-b4b6-490e-9e1c-96e301286ce7","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spaceshiptwo_image_20210522140909.jpeg","name":"SpaceShipTwo | VSS Unity VP-03","net":"2018-12-13T12:00:00Z"},{"id":"ae2019cd-f87e-4066-997f-b6c7842febf8","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spaceshiptwo_image_20210522140909.jpeg","name":"SpaceShipTwo | VSS Unity GF08","net":"2020-05-01T15:14:00Z"},{"id":"182a1c2f-c36a-4444-8599-448516ac1c2d","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spaceshiptwo_image_20210522140909.jpeg","name":"SpaceShipTwo | VSS Unity VF-03","net":"2021-05-22T15:27:00Z"},{"id":"2d856109-a430-48b7-bff6-4b3abb6a1e0d","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spaceshiptwo_image_20210522140909.jpeg","name":"SpaceShipTwo | VSS Unity GF03","net":"2017-02-24T12:00:00Z"},{"id":"f7ce04b3-b674-48d0-aa14-dfba4fae122c","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/space_shuttle_image_20230422074810.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Discovery / OV-103 | STS-105","net":"2001-08-10T21:10:14Z"},{"id":"a59c24dc-c74f-4937-80f0-420cfd6d32e6","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spaceshiptwo_image_20210522140909.jpeg","name":"SpaceShipTwo | VSS Unity VF-02","net":"2020-12-12T15:24:00Z"},{"id":"0e03b32b-b58d-4564-b92a-b26b4be57062","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spaceshiptwo_image_20210522140909.jpeg","name":"SpaceShipTwo | VSS Unity GF06","net":"2017-08-04T12:00:00Z"},{"id":"c2eaf9fc-c9bd-4882-bfc5-21c11eef95e4","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spaceshiptwo_image_20210522140909.jpeg","name":"SpaceShipTwo | VSS Unity CF01","net":"2017-06-01T12:00:00Z"},{"id":"ec687378-90e5-4c5e-ba99-f214c3730b55","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spaceshiptwo_image_20210522140909.jpeg","name":"SpaceShipTwo | VSS Enterprise GF30","net":"2014-10-07T12:00:00Z"},{"id":"6db9ec90-51c6-4307-8158-7993cf876d2c","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/space_shuttle_image_20230422074810.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Atlantis / OV-104 | STS-117","net":"2007-06-08T23:38:04Z"},{"id":"2bdc40c7-3b72-4ed1-88ec-127facd252ca","image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/space_shuttle_image_20230422074810.jpeg","name":"Space Shuttle Discovery / OV-103 | STS-128","net":"2009-08-29T03:59:37Z"}],"last_flight":"2024-01-26T17:42:05Z","first_flight":"1998-12-04T08:35:34Z"},{"id":475,"name":"Michael P.
