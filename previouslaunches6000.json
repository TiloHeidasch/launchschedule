In 1948, it was turned over to the French Air Force, who renamed it CIEES. Its remote location in the middle of the Saharan Desert and its relative closeness to the Equator (compared with Metropolitan France) made it an attractive launch site for missiles and orbital rockets.","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_147_20240808092142.jpg","timezone_name":"Africa/Algiers","total_launch_count":4,"total_landing_count":0}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_141_20200803143211.jpg"},"vidURLs":[],"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/diamant_a_lifto_image_20240411170731.png","infographic":null},{"id":"a083fe50-faf7-4f87-8f74-f027bc469fda","name":"Atlas SLV-3 Agena D | KH-7 25","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"1966-02-15T20:30:00Z","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":161,"name":"United States Air Force","abbrev":"USAF","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/united2520states2520air2520force_logo_20230804084626.png","image_url":null,"nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/united2520states2520air2520force_nation_20230804085132.jpg"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":258,"name":"Atlas SLV-3 Agena D","family":"Atlas","full_name":"Atlas SLV-3 Agena D"}},"mission":{"id":1911,"name":"KH-7 25","description":"The Program 206 satellite, carrying the KH-7 (Keyhole 7) camera system (codenamed Gambit-1), was the first successful high resolution space reconnaissance program.

The mission lasted 1 day, 2 hours, 2 minutes & 17 seconds completing a total of 17 orbits around Earth. The mission had many issues, for example during his spacewalk his spacesuit ballooned up to a point where his suit became stiff. In order to move his limbs again and re-enter the airlock he had to bleed off some of the suit's pressure. After re-entering the capsule,the crew had trouble sealing the hatch, during re-entry the orbital module did not properly disconnect from the landing module causing the spacecraft to spin wildly until turbulence caused them to separate at around 100 km and the automatic landing system failed and the crew had to rely on the manual backup. Earlier troubles meant that spacecraft landed 386 km away from their targeted landing zome in the forests of Upper Kama Upland.","type":"Human Exploration"},"pad":{"id":32,"name":"1/5","location":{"id":15,"name":{"id":15,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/15/?format=json","name":"Baikonur Cosmodrome, Republic of Kazakhstan","country_code":"KAZ","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_15_20200803142517.jpg","timezone_name":"Asia/Qyzylorda","total_launch_count":1550,"total_landing_count":0}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_32_20200803143513.jpg"},"vidURLs":[],"image":null,"infographic":null},{"id":"40cb69e3-83d2-417e-8085-6e9526319760","name":"Thor MG-18 | DSAP-1 F11","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"1965-03-18T04:43:46Z","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":161,"name":"United States Air Force","abbrev":"USAF","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/united2520states2520air2520force_logo_20230804084626.png","image_url":null,"nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/united2520states2520air2520force_nation_20230804085132.jpg"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":413,"name":"Thor MG-18","family":"Thor","full_name":"Thor MG-18"}},"mission":{"id":1797,"name":"DSAP-1 F11","description":"The DSAP-1 (Defense Satellite Application Program Block 1) satellites series, also known as P-35, was the first series of military meteorologal satellites of the USA.","type":"Government/Top Secret"},"pad":{"id":171,"name":"Space Launch Complex 10W","location":{"id":11,"name":{"id":11,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/11/?format=json","name":"Vandenberg SFB, CA, USA","country_code":"USA","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg","timezone_name":"America/Los_Angeles","total_launch_count":769,"total_landing_count":20}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_171_20200803143449.jpg"},"vidURLs":[],"image":null,"infographic":null},{"id":"0d5c410c-8abf-405a-8ac8-1da391523c7c","name":"Kosmos 65S3 | Strela-1 12,13,14","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"1965-03-15T11:00:00Z","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":66,"name":"Soviet Space Program","abbrev":"CCCP","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/soviet2520space2520program_logo_20191229081307.png","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/soviet2520space2520program_image_20191229081306.jpeg","nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/soviet2520space2520program_nation_20191229081307.png"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":329,"name":"Kosmos 65S3","family":"Kosmos","full_name":"Kosmos 65S3"}},"mission":{"id":1796,"name":"Strela-1 12,13,14","description":"The Strela-1 satellites were prototype store-dump communications satellites for tactical communication.","type":"Government/Top Secret"},"pad":{"id":164,"name":"41/15","location":{"id":15,"name":{"id":15,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/15/?format=json","name":"Baikonur Cosmodrome, Republic of Kazakhstan","country_code":"KAZ","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_15_20200803142517.jpg","timezone_name":"Asia/Qyzylorda","total_launch_count":1550,"total_landing_count":0}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_164_20200803143415.jpg"},"vidURLs":[],"image":null,"infographic":null},{"id":"32708cee-e62c-4904-8f6d-57b5a859c759","name":"Atlas SLV-3 Agena D | KH-7 16","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"1965-03-12T19:20:00Z","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":161,"name":"United States Air Force","abbrev":"USAF","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/united2520states2520air2520force_logo_20230804084626.png","image_url":null,"nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/united2520states2520air2520force_nation_20230804085132.jpg"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":258,"name":"Atlas SLV-3 Agena D","family":"Atlas","full_name":"Atlas SLV-3 Agena D"}},"mission":{"id":1795,"name":"KH-7 16","description":"The Program 206 satellite, carrying the KH-7 (Keyhole 7) camera system (codenamed Gambit-1), was the first successful high resolution space reconnaissance program.
