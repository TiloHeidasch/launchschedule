atmospheric environment, named Daqi-1, also known as Atmospheric Environment Monitoring Satellite (AEMS) and developed by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST) in Shanghai, is designed to operate in sun-synchronous orbit. Daqi-1 can monitor fine particle pollution like PM2.5, pollutant gases including nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone, as well as carbon dioxide concentration.\r\n\r\nIt combines both passive and active sensing, which can realize comprehensive monitoring of the atmospheric environment in a better way, according to a chief designer with SAST. The detection accuracy of fine particles and carbon dioxide column concentration by Daqi-1 has reached the international advanced level, the chief designer said. The atmospheric detection lidar deployed on the satellite is also the world's first that is capable of detecting both atmospheric aerosols and carbon dioxide.","type":"Earth Science"},"pad":{"id":25,"name":"Launch Complex 9","location":{"id":19,"name":{"id":19,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/19/?format=json","name":"Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center, People's Republic of China","country_code":"CHN","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_19_20200803142421.jpg","timezone_name":"Asia/Shanghai","total_launch_count":131,"total_landing_count":0}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_25_20200803143501.jpg"},"vidURLs":[],"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/long_march_4c_image_20230801172338.jpeg","infographic":null},{"id":"d2fd487e-432b-4ffd-9bf7-57f870befb5a","name":"Long March 3B | ChinaSat 6D","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"2022-04-15T12:00:00Z","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":88,"name":"China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation","abbrev":"CASC","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/china2520aerospace2520science2520and2520technology2520corporation_logo_20220826093937.png","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/china2520aerospace2520science2520and2520technology2520corporation_image_20191228094408.jpeg","nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/china2520aerospace2520science2520and2520technology2520corporation_nation_20230604193716.png"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":50,"name":"Long March 3","family":"Long March","full_name":"Long March 3B/E"}},"mission":{"id":6007,"name":"ChinaSat 6D","description":"ZX 6D (Zhongxing 6D, ChinaSat 6D) is a Chinese communications satellite based upon a DFH-4 bus.

It will feature an X-band synthetic aperture radar.\r\n\r\nStriX β is an upgraded version of the StriX α prototype. The satellite features two deployable panes, one side carrying solar cells, the other carrying the X-band radar antenna.\r\n\r\nThe StriX satellite constellation can target data with a ground resolution of 1-3 m, single polarized (VV), and a swath width of more than 10-30 km. The StriX observation modes are Stripmap and Sliding Spotlight mode and each satellite has an SAR antenna that is 5 meters in length and stowed during launch. The simple design of the satellites allows for affordable development of the constellation.\r\n\r\nStriX β was planned to be launched in 2021 on a Soyuz-2-1a Fregat or Soyuz-2-1b Fregat rideshare mission, but as this mission was delayed, it was re-booked on a dedicated Electron KS launch.\r\n\r\nSynspective is planning a constellation of 25 satellites called StriX, comprised of 100-kilogram satellites capable of imaging at a resolution of one to three meters. By 2022 the company plans to have six satellites in orbit. The company has not set a date by which it hopes to achieve 25 satellites.","type":"Earth Science"},"pad":{"id":185,"name":"Rocket Lab Launch Complex

The satellites take advantage of the reduction in mass that this electric propulsion technology enables for a dual payload mission, with an exceptionally large next generation digitally processed payload.\r\n\r\nI-6 F1 and F2 both carry a large 9 m aperture L-band antenna and nine multibeam Ka-band antennas, and feature a high level of flexibility and connectivity. A new generation modular digital processor provides full routing flexibility over up to 8000 channels and dynamic power allocation to over 200 spot beams in L-band. Ka-band spot beams are steerable over the full Earth disk, with flexible channel to beam allocation.","type":"Communications"},"pad":{"id":41,"name":"Yoshinobu Launch Complex LP-1","location":{"id":26,"name":{"id":26,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/26/?format=json","name":"Tanegashima Space Center, Japan","country_code":"JPN","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_26_20200803142507.jpg","timezone_name":"Asia/Tokyo","total_launch_count":91,"total_landing_count":0}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_41_20200803143551.jpg"},"vidURLs":[{"priority":9,"source":null,"publisher":null,"title":"Live streaming for the launch of H-IIA F45 with I-6 F1/ H-IIAロケット45号機による通信衛星Inmarsat-6 F1 打上げライブ中継","description":"Watch Live streaming for the launch of H-IIA Launch Vehicle No. 45.Inmarsat-6 F1, the first satellite in Inmarsat's sixth series of satellites, Inmarsat-6, i...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-46i9KT83wM/maxresdefault_live.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-46i9KT83wM","type":null,"language":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null},{"priority":10,"source":null,"publisher":null,"title":"Inmarsat-6 F1 launch","description":"Tune in to watch the launch of I-6 F1 from the JAXA Tanegashima Space Centre in Japan with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h3aBfB8NdEQ/maxresdefault_live.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3aBfB8NdEQ","type":null,"language":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null}],"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/h-iia_204_lifto_image_20240325124231.jpg","infographic":null},{"id":"878ba32c-5e93-4d2b-95c3-24b60c8b05e7","name":"Falcon 9 Block 5 | Dragon CRS-2 SpX-24","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"2021-12-21T10:07:08Z","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":121,"name":"SpaceX","abbrev":"SpX","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spacex_logo_20220826094919.png","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spacex_image_20190207032501.jpeg","nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/spacex_nation_20230531064544.jpg"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":164,"name":"Falcon 9","family":"Falcon","full_name":"Falcon 9 Block 5"},"spacecraft_stage":{"launch_crew":[]}},"mission":{"id":1306,"name":"Dragon CRS-2 SpX-24","description":"24th commercial resupply services mission to the International Space Station operated by SpaceX.

DART's primary objective is to demonstrate a kinetic impact on a small asteroid.  The binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos is the target for DART.   While Didymos' primary body is approximately 800 meters across, its secondary body has a 150-meter size, which is more typical of the size of asteroids that could pose a more common hazard to Earth.\r\n\r\nThe DART spacecraft will achieve the kinetic impact by deliberately crashing itself into the moonlet at a speed of approximately 6 km/s, with the aid of an onboard camera and sophisticated autonomous navigation software. The collision will change the speed of the moonlet in its orbit around the main body by a fraction of one percent, enough to be measured using telescopes on Earth.","type":"Robotic Exploration"},"pad":{"id":16,"name":"Space Launch Complex 4E","location":{"id":11,"name":{"id":11,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/11/?format=json","name":"Vandenberg SFB, CA, USA","country_code":"USA","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg","timezone_name":"America/Los_Angeles","total_launch_count":769,"total_landing_count":20}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_16_20200803143532.jpg"},"vidURLs":[{"priority":0,"source":null,"publisher":null,"title":"Falcon 9 DART","description":"Falcon 9 DART with initial coverage and post coverage cutThumbnail Photo Credit: SpaceX","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fm98PkhbTVg/maxresdefault.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm98PkhbTVg","type":null,"language":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null},{"priority":9,"source":null,"publisher":null,"title":"Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) Mission","description":"SpaceX is targeting Tuesday, November 23 for Falcon 9’s launch of NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission from Space Launch Complex 4 East (SL...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKRf6-NcMqI/maxresdefault_live.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKRf6-NcMqI","type":null,"language":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null},{"priority":10,"source":null,"publisher":null,"title":"Watch NASA’s DART Mission Launch (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) Official Broadcast/Stream","description":"Can we change the motion of an asteroid?

The satellites span a range of operations, from TriSept’s tech demonstration of new tether systems designed to accelerate spacecraft reentry and reduce orbital debris, through to the next generation of maritime surveillance satellites for Unseenlabs, as well as communications satellites for Swarm. The mission will also deploy New Zealand’s first student-built satellite, the APSS-1 satellite for Te Pūnaha Ātea - Auckland Space Institute at The University of Auckland.\r\n\r\nThe DRAGRACER mission will test the effectiveness of new tether technologies designed to accelerate spacecraft reentry and reduce orbital debris at the conclusion of space missions. TriSept has completed the integration of a pair of qualified Millennium Space Systems 6U small satellites, one featuring the tether drag device and one without. The controlled spacecraft should deorbit in approximately 45 days, while the second spacecraft is expected to remain in orbit for seven to nine years.\r\n\r\nBRO-2 and BRO-3 are the second and third satellites in French company Unseenlabs’ planned constellation of about 20 satellites dedicated to maritime surveillance. \r\n\r\nSwarm will launch the latest 24 1/4U SpaceBEE satellites to continue building out its planned constellation of 150 satellites to provide affordable satellite communications services to IoT devices in remote regions around the world. \r\n\r\nThe student-built Waka Āmiorangi Aotearoa APSS-1 satellite is designed to monitor electrical activity in Earth’s upper atmosphere to test whether ionospheric disturbances can predict earthquakes.\r\n\r\nExtra payload on this flight is a 150 mm 3D printed Half-Life Gnome Chompski. Created for Valve Software's co-founder Gabe Newell by design studio Weta Workshop, it serves as an homage to the innovation and creativity of gamers worldwide, and also aims to test and qualify a novel 3D printing technique that could be employed for future spacecraft components. Gnome will remain attached to the Kick Stage and will burn up on reentry.\r\n\r\nBesides payloads, this flight will also serve as a test of Electron's reusability. Rocket Lab will attempt to bring Electron’s first stage back to Earth under a parachute system for a controlled water landing before collection by a recovery vessel.","type":"Dedicated Rideshare"},"pad":{"id":65,"name":"Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1A","location":{"id":10,"name":{"id":10,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/10/?format=json","name":"Onenui Station, Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand","country_code":"NZL","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_10_20200803142509.jpg","timezone_name":"Pacific/Auckland","total_launch_count":48,"total_landing_count":17}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_65_20200803143549.jpg"},"vidURLs":[{"priority":10,"source":null,"publisher":null,"title":"Rocket Lab 'Return To Sender' Launch","description":"Enjoy the videos and music you love, upload original content, and share it all with friends, family, and the world on YouTube.","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eZGI_lHGltA/maxresdefault_live.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZGI_lHGltA","type":null,"language":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null}],"image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/electron25202_image_20201120015105.jpg","infographic":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/infographic_images/electron25202_infographic_20201112150118.png"},{"id":"d9486816-bb61-4b16-bcfa-0d1e9ba40696","name":"Vega | SEOSAT-Ingenio & Taranis","status":{"id":4,"name":"Launch Failure"},"net":"2020-11-17T01:52:20Z","hashtag":"#SEOSATIngenio","launch_service_provider":{"id":115,"name":"Arianespace","abbrev":"ASA","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/arianespace_logo_20210603173752.png","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/arianespace_image_20190207032425.jpeg","nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/arianespace_nation_20230530190314.jpg"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":167,"name":"Vega","family":"Vega","full_name":"Vega"}},"mission":{"id":693,"name":"SEOSAT-Ingenio & Taranis","description":"SEOSAT-Ingenio is a high-resolution optical imaging mission of Spain - the flagship mission of the Spanish space strategic plan.

The chosen landing area is Utopia Planitia, a huge basin formed by a large impact far back in Mars' history. The rover is expected to be in operation for about 90 Martian sols. The Tianwen-1 orbiter will provide a relay communication link to the rover while performing its own scientific observations for one Martian year.\n\nThe orbiter will operate in a polar orbit in order to  map Mars' morphology and geological structure while also using the Mars-Orbiting Subsurface Exploration Radar instrument to investigate soil characteristics and water-ice distribution. It will also measure the ionosphere and the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, the new paper reported. The rover will have 13 instruments detecting things such as topography, soil, environment, atmosphere, water ice, physical field and internal structure. It will investigate the surface soil characteristics and water-ice distribution with its own Subsurface Exploration Radar. It will also analyze surface material composition and characteristics of the Martian climate and environment on the surface.","type":"Robotic Exploration"},"pad":{"id":175,"name":"101","location":{"id":8,"name":{"id":8,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/8/?format=json","name":"Wenchang Space Launch Site, People's Republic of China","country_code":"CHN","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_8_20200803142445.jpg","timezone_name":"Asia/Shanghai","total_launch_count":31,"total_landing_count":0}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_175_20200803143424.jpg"},"vidURLs":[{"priority":10,"source":null,"publisher":null,"title":"[回放]中国首次独立火星探测任务(长征五号/天问一号) [Replay] China's first independent Mars mission (LongMarch-5/Tianwen-1)","description":"7月23日，中国火星探测任务“天问一号”在海南文昌卫星发射中心发射升空。这是中国首次执行火星探测任务，任务目标是通过一次发射，实现火星环绕、着陆和巡视探测。 China's Long March-5 Y4 carrier rocket, carrying the Mars probe, blasted off a...","feature_image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LXZnmANq-rw/hqdefault.jpg","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXZnmANq-rw","type":null,"language":null,"start_time":null,"end_time":null},{"priority":10,"source":null,"publisher":null,"title":"Tianwen-1 Mars Launch Live Stream","description":"China is targeting 04:00 on 7/23/2020 UTC for liftoff of their Tianwen-1 Mars mission aboard their Long March 5 rocket.

The baseline mission of the satellite is to provide 75 Gbps of capacity across a network of 65 spotbeams that together provide quasi-complete coverage of Sub-Saharan Africa. The satellite will address direct-to-user consumer and enterprise broadband services using dishes from approximately 75 cm. It will also be used for community networks connected to Wi-Fi hotspots, mobile phone backhauling and rural connectivity.\r\nEutelsat Konnect is the first to use Thales Alenia Spaceâ€™s all-electric Spacebus NEO platform, developed under the Neosat Partnership Project conducted by the European and French space agencies (ESA and CNES). More robust, more modular, more powerful, more innovative, more flexible, this platform is perfectly adapted to operators' expectations in the evolving telecommunication market, and particlularly well positioned for very demanding VHTS missions.

It's one out of two satellites to replace the first generation COSMO-SkyMed system.\n\nThis second-generation system, including its ground segment, will set a new performance standard for space-based radar observation systems in terms of precision, image quality and the flexibility of user services. It is a dual (civil/military) system, designed to address the requirements of both commercial and government customers, as well as the scientific community. The COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation satellites are equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR), capable of observations under any weather or light conditions, day or night. \n\nThe Characterising Exoplanet Satellite (CHEOPS) is an ESA mission implemented in partnership â€“ in particular with Switzerland.\n\nCHEOPS is the first mission dedicated to studying bright, nearby stars that already are known to host  exoplanets in order to make high-precision observations of the planet's size as it passes in front of its host star. The spacecraft will focus on planets in the super-Earth to Neptune size range, with its data enabling the bulk density of the planets to be derived â€“ a first characterization step towards understanding these alien worlds.\n\nFlight also includes 3 auxiliary payloads: OPS-SAT, EyeSat, ANGELS.\n\nOPS-SAT is the worldâ€™s first free-for-use, in-orbit test bed for new software, applications and techniques in satellite control. It enables new software to be tested in orbit. In the first year of operation, OPS-SAT will host over 100 in-flight experiments submitted from many ESA Member States.\n\nEyeSat is a 3U CubeSat designed to study the zodiacal light and image the Milky Way. It's fitted with an instrument called IRIS, which is a small space telescope.\n\nANGELS is a 12U CubeSat, and is the French industryâ€™s first nanosatellite. The satellite will be fitted with a miniaturized ARGOS NÃ©o instrument, which is 10-times smaller than the equivalent previous-generation device. The instrument collects and determines the position of low-power signals and messages sent by the 20,000 ARGOS beacons now in service worldwide.","type":"Dedicated Rideshare"},"pad":{"id":81,"name":"Soyuz Launch Complex","location":{"id":13,"name":{"id":13,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/13/?format=json","name":"Guiana Space Centre, French Guiana","country_code":"GUF","description":"The Guiana Space Centre is a European spaceport to the northwest of Kourou in French Guiana, a region of France in South America.

Designed to remain in service in orbit for more than 15 years, TIBA-1 will have a launch mass of 5600 kg and an electric power capability of higher than 9 kW.\r\n\r\nInmarsat-5 F5 (Global Xpress-5 or GX-5) is Inmarsat's very high throughput satellite (V-HTS), which will offer services covering the Middle East, Europe and the Indian sub-continent. The payload will be fully integrated into Inmarsatâ€™s current Global Express high-speed network. Inmarsat-5 F5 satellite is based on Thales Alenia Spaceâ€™s upgraded Spacebus 4000 B2 platform and will be fitted with 72 Ka-band beams. With a specified design life of 16 years, it will weigh 4007 kg at launch and will offer payload power of about 6.8 kW.","type":"Communications"},"pad":{"id":77,"name":"Ariane Launch Area 3","location":{"id":13,"name":{"id":13,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/13/?format=json","name":"Guiana Space Centre, French Guiana","country_code":"GUF","description":"The Guiana Space Centre is a European spaceport to the northwest of Kourou in French Guiana, a region of France in South America.

Eutelsat 5 West B will provide business continuity and improved quality for these services via a Ku-band payload. The satellite is built on Orbital ATKs GEOStar-2e bus and carries 35 equivalent 36 MHz Ku-band transponders connected to three service areas. Switchable transponders will also increase commercial flexibility.\n\nCo-passenger on this flight will be provided Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. MEV-1 (Mission Extension Vehicle-1) incorporates flight-proven technologies the company has used in its commercial satellite and space logistics businesses. After successfully completing a series of in-orbit tests, the MEV-1 will begin its mission extension service for Intelsat-901 satellite in the graveyard orbit. MEV-1 will relocate the satellite scheduled for the mission extension service, which is planned for a five-year period, after which Intelsat 901 will be place back into graveyard orbit. Intelsat will also have the option to service multiple satellites using the same MEV.\n\nMEV-1 is based on the companyâ€™s GEOStar-3 spacecraft bus platform. Controlled by the companyâ€™s satellite operations team, the MEV-1 uses a reliable, low-risk docking system that attaches to existing features on a customerâ€™s satellite. The MEV-1 provides life-extending services by taking over the propulsion and attitude control functions.

After a controlled descent, the lander will perform a soft landing on the lunar surface at a specified site and deploy the rover. Six-wheeled rover weighs around 20 kg and will operate on solar power. It will move around the landing site, performing lunar surface chemical analysis and relaying data back to Earth through the orbiter. The lander will be collecting data on Moon-quakes, thermal properties of the lunar surface, the density and variation of lunar surface plasma. The orbiter will be mapping lunar surface.

The primary purpose of the RCM is to provide C-Band data continuity for RADARSAT-2 users, as well as adding a new series of applications enabled through the constellation approach.\n\nThe main uses of RCM are expected to be in the areas of: maritime surveillance (ship detection, ice monitoring, and oil spill detection), disaster management, ecosystem monitoring.\n\nThe primary areas of interest are the landmass of Canada and its surrounding Arctic, Pacific and Atlantic maritime areas. The images and derived information are required to be provided to Canadian government users at frequent area coverage rates. Contrary to the earlier RadarSat missions, the imagery will not be available commercially.\n\nThe spacecraft Payload will consist of a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor integrated with an Automated Identification System (AIS).
