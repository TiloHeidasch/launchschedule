This mission was the final flight before the Challenger disaster, which caused the Space Shuttle program to be suspended until 1988, and impacted NASA's Payload Specialist program for even longer.

He was made a prime crew member of Soyuz MS-04 but, due to Russian budget cuts, the crews were changed and Tikhonov was then slated to make his first spaceflight on the Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft. He was again removed from the manifest due to delays in launching the Russian Nauka module. He was scheduled to fly into space as commander of the Soyuz MS-15 mission, although he was removed for a third time following the aborted launch of Soyuz MS-10, and the subsequent crew changes that followed. He was then scheduled to finally make his first flight onboard Soyuz MS-16 in 2020. However he reportedly got an eye injury a month before the launch, was replaced on the flight, and subsequently left the cosmonaut corps due to health issues.","profile_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/nikolai2520tikhonov_image_20200129210520.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/255bauto255d__image_thumbnail_20240305191106.jpeg","agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"flights":[],"last_flight":null,"first_flight":null},{"id":645,"name":"Andrei Babkin","nationality":"Russian","date_of_birth":"1969-04-21","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Andrei Nikolaevich Babkin (Russian: Андре́й Никола́евич Ба́бкин) is a Russian Engineer and Cosmonaut who was selected in April 2010.","profile_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/andrei2520babkin_image_20200129210447.jpg","profile_image_thumbnail":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/255bauto255d__image_thumbnail_20240305185251.jpeg","agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"flights":[],"last_flight":null,"first_flight":null},{"id":646,"name":"Ivan Vagner","nationality":"Russian","date_of_birth":"1985-07-10","date_of_death":null,"bio":"Ivan Viktorovitch Vagner is a Russian Engineer and Cosmonaut who was selected in October 2010.

But it was the opportunity to do legislative research for U.S. Senator John Glenn – the former Mercury astronaut –that cemented his lifelong passion for space.

Now, after flying aboard ‘Galactic 06,’ space travel has forever changed the way Neil looks at the universe and his place in it, just as Glenn told him it would.
