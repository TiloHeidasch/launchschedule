It was designed to yield atmospheric density near perigee as a function of space and time from sequential observations of the sphere's position in orbit.","type":"Earth Science"},"pad":{"id":154,"name":"Space Launch Complex 5","location":{"id":11,"name":{"id":11,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/11/?format=json","name":"Vandenberg SFB, CA, USA","country_code":"USA","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg","timezone_name":"America/Los_Angeles","total_launch_count":769,"total_landing_count":20}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_154_20200803143408.jpg"},"vidURLs":[],"image":null,"infographic":null},{"id":"3ce5f46a-0fed-405f-a8cf-5b4fc9ece5c9","name":"Thor SLV-2A Agena D | KH-4A 14","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"1964-11-18T20:35:54Z","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":161,"name":"United States Air Force","abbrev":"USAF","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/united2520states2520air2520force_logo_20230804084626.png","image_url":null,"nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/united2520states2520air2520force_nation_20230804085132.jpg"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":417,"name":"Thor SLV-2A Agena D","family":"Thor","full_name":"Thor SLV-2A Agena D"}},"mission":{"id":1758,"name":"KH-4A 14","description":"The KH-4A (Keyhole-4A) was the fifth optical reconnaissance satellite version in the Corona-program.","type":"Government/Top Secret"},"pad":{"id":98,"name":"Space Launch Complex 2E","location":{"id":11,"name":{"id":11,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/11/?format=json","name":"Vandenberg SFB, CA, USA","country_code":"USA","description":"","map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg","timezone_name":"America/Los_Angeles","total_launch_count":769,"total_landing_count":20}},"map_image":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_98_20200803143228.jpg"},"vidURLs":[],"image":null,"infographic":null},{"id":"987a5d22-661e-43bc-a6f2-68f7f0d35ae2","name":"Nike Cajun | Trailblazer Pellet","status":{"id":3,"name":"Launch Successful"},"net":"1964-11-07T01:38:00Z","hashtag":null,"launch_service_provider":{"id":44,"name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","abbrev":"NASA","logo_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/national2520aeronautics2520and2520space2520administration_logo_20190207032448.png","image_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/national2520aeronautics2520and2520space2520administration_image_20190207032448.jpeg","nation_url":"https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/national2520aeronautics2520and2520space2520administration_nation_20230803040809.jpg"},"rocket":{"configuration":{"id":342,"name":"Nike Cajun","family":"","full_name":"Nike Cajun"}},"mission":{"id":1683,"name":"Trailblazer Pellet","description":"Test mission.

This was the last time an American was launched to space on a solo orbital mission. The mission had several technical problems, the biggest which was a short-circuit in the bus bar serving the 250 volt main inverter causing the automatic stabilization and control system to stop working during the 21st orbit. In the end Cooper had to use lines he had drawn on the window and his wristwatch to correctly execute burns to safely re-enter the atmosphere.","type":"Human Exploration"},"pad":{"id":17,"name":"Space
