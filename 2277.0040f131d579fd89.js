was one of two principal components of the United States Apollo spacecraft, used for the Apollo program which landed astronauts on the Moon between 1969 and 1972. The CSM functioned as a mother ship which carried a crew of three astronauts and the second Apollo spacecraft, the Lunar Module, to lunar orbit, and brought the astronauts back to Earth. It consisted of two parts: the conical Command Module, a cabin that housed the crew and carried equipment needed for atmospheric reentry and splashdown; and the cylindrical Service Module which provided propulsion, electrical power and storage for various consumables required during a mission. An umbilical connection transferred power and consumables between the two modules. Just before reentry of the Command Module on the return home, the umbilical connection was severed and the Service Module was cast off and allowed to burn up in the atmosphere.","maiden_flight":"1966-02-26","height":11,"diameter":3.9,"human_rated":true,"crew_capacity":3,"payload_capacity":1050,"flight_life":"14 days","image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/orbiter_images/apollo2520command2fservice2520module_image_20190207032507.jpeg","nation_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/agency_nation/apollo2520command2fservice2520module_image_20190207032507.png","wiki_link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Command/Service_Module","info_link":""},{"id":17,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/spacecraft/17/?format=json","name":"Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV)","type":{"id":1,"name":"Unknown"},"agency":{"id":115,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/115/?format=json","name":"Arianespace","featured":true,"type":"Commercial","country_code":"FRA","abbrev":"ASA","description":"Arianespace SA is a multinational company founded in 1980 as the world\'s first commercial launch service provider.

In October 1995, it was agreed that, amongst the various contributions to the ISS program that Europe would assume responsibility for under the vestiges of the European Space Agency (ESA), would be the Automated Transfer Vehicle, or ATV; this logistics-orientated spacecraft would perform the identified resupply missions to ISS.","details":"In terms of its role, the ATV was designed to complement the smaller Russian Progress spacecraft, possessing three times its useful payload capacity. Similar to the Progress, it would carry both bulk liquids and relatively fragile freight, which would be stored within a cargo hold maintained at a pressurized shirt-sleeve environment in order that astronauts would be able to access payloads without the need to put on spacesuits. The pressurized cargo section of the ATV was based on the Italian-built Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM), which was a Shuttle-carried \\"space barge\\" that had been previously used for transporting equipment to and from the Station. Unlike the MPLM, the ATV used the same docking mechanism as employed upon the Progress. The ATV, like the Progress, also serves as a container for the station\'s waste. Each ATV weighs 20.7 tonnes at launch and has a cargo capacity of 8 tonnes.","maiden_flight":"2008-03-09","height":10.3,"diameter":4.5,"human_rated":false,"crew_capacity":null,"payload_capacity":7667,"flight_life":"Six months when docked","image_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/orbiter_images/automated2520transfer2520vehicle25202528atv2529_image_20190207032508.jpeg","nation_url":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/agency_nation/automated2520transfer2520vehicle25202528atv2529_image_20190207032508.png","wiki_link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Transfer_Vehicle","info_link":""},{"id":28,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/spacecraft/28/?format=json","name":"Buran","type":{"id":1,"name":"Unknown"},"agency":{"id":63,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","featured":true,"type":"Government","country_code":"RUS","abbrev":"RFSA","description":"The Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities, commonly known as Roscosmos, is the governmental body responsible for the space science program of the Russian Federation and general aerospace research.

Buran completed one uncrewed orbital spaceflight in 1988, after which it was recovered successfully. Although the Buran class was similar in appearance to NASA\'s Space Shuttle orbiter, and could similarly operate as a re-entry spaceplane, its internal and functional design was distinct. For example, the main engines during launch were on the Energia rocket and were not taken into orbit by the spacecraft.
