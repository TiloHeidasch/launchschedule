Back in 1993, my parents took me to KSC. Back then I was completely overwhelmed and was not fully able to process everything. However, upon first sight of the Space Shuttle External Tank, I appearantly called it the chocolate rocket due to its brown-ish appeal.","Growing older, I eventually learned how to develop mobile apps, hence I developed my first Android App - Launchschedule. Based on LaunchLibrary1.","Getting more experience and learning more technologies, I used the sundown of LL1 and replacement by LL2 as the trigger to create RCKET.","First being called Launchschedule, in a lack of a better name, I have now decided to call this App RCKET.","RCKET is fully open source.
